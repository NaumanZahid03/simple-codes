    <h2>Claim to fame</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Since his student days, he started writing poetry in Balochi. His first poetry book <mark>‘Zarnawishat’</mark> 
        was published in <mark>1990</mark> and the last collection of his poetry <mark>‘Shaklian Jurani Broad’</mark> was
        published in 2022. He has more than 10 collections of poetry to his credit. His poetry was recited and sung by
        famous singers on radio and TV programmes. Legendary singer late Noor Muhammad Bizenjo rose to fame on the back
        of the Balochi poetry penned by Mr Qazi.

        The famed poet had an active political career as well. He was arrested in 1982 for the first time after he
        sprotested the death sentence handed to a Balochistan Student Organisation leader Hameed Baloch who was accused of
        shooting at a military delegation of Oman which had come to Turbat for recruitment of Baloch youth for the Omani
        army. Mr Qazi was held at Central Jail Mach at the time.

        In 2007, the revolutionary poet spent eight months in jail in Turbat for his radical poetry. In addition to a
        dozen cases lodged against him for his poems, he was the first Balochi poet who was implicated in a treason
        case. However, he was acquitted in all cases. He distanced himself from active politics after his son Kambar
        Mubarak, who was affiliated with a radical separatist outfit, was killed in 2014.

        Balochistan interim Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Domki, Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal,
        National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch and others expressed grief over the death and paid rich tributes
        to the poet for his work to promote the Balochi language. They said that Mubarak Qazi was a man of principle who
        never compromised on his principles. He will always be remembered as a shining star of the Baloch nationalist
        movement, they said.

        “HRCP is deeply saddened by the death of leading poet Mubarak Qazi in Turbat. Qazi gave a new meaning to romance
        with political resistance in Balochi poetry. We offer condolences to his family, friends, and readers,” the Human
        Rights Commission of Pakistan said in a tweet.
